# Malware-Related Sentence Classification

This repo contains the code for the ICTAI 2021 paper "*Enrichment of Features for Malware-Related Sentence Classification using External Knowledge*".

## Installation

Installation from the source. Python's virtual or Conda environments are recommended.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chaumng/malware_related_sentence_classification.git
cd malware_related_sentence_classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This repo is tested on Python 3.7.

## Classification and Evaluation

### Preprocess data

```bash
python preprocess_data.py
```

### Parameter searching: Classify and evaluate

In this repo, we already provided the GAT weak labels in a file.
To perform parameter searching, run the following command. The default value is to perform the second grid search. You can change the value of the argument *param\_grid\_setting* to "*first\_grid\_search*" perform the first grid search, or to "*best_setting*" to run only the best setting.

```bash
python svm_param_search.py --param_grid_setting second_grid_search
```
